Kevin started with the Human Enginuity team in 2015 as the Program Manager for the Product for payments at Xero, Inc. where he provided strategic guidance to team and project managers supporting the team and its culture. Kevin was able to identify and negotiate contracts with key vendors that lead to increase ROI on projects, successfully worked with external teams to build interdependent roadmaps, timelines, priorities and provided weekly status communications to external stakeholders.  Kevin was able to identify potential roadblocks and jump in successfully to ensure the team was able to meet delivery deadlines.

Previously, Kevin was the Operations Manager at LearnBig, a corporate e-Learning startup where he was responsible for day-to-day operations. Kevin successfully introduced new processes and procedures to ensure key systems were running smoothly in order to meet the needs and expectations of the staff and customers through LearnBig's acquisition in May 2015 and again for its 2nd acquisition in 2017.
