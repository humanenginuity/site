Prior to founding Human Enginuity SPC, Brad co-founded LearnBIG, where he developed pioneering online e-Learning experiences that industry experts and customers alike referred to as “stunning”, “exceptional”, “effective” and “unique”. Brad served as LearnBig's CTO through its acquisition in May 2015.

As a software engineer, Brad began programming in BASIC, 6510 and later 68K assembly language. Then, after the demise of the dinosaurs, evolved to work in C, Modern C++, Javascript, C# and Rust.

Current projects include a systems project developing a large-scale, real-time embedded systems project in Rust. Recent projects include co-developing and shipping a major financial payment service on top of the U.S. Federal Reserve banking system.

Brad previously spent time working for Microsoft Research leading a team responsible for developing educational games in collaboration with several major universities designed to teach children (with particular emphasis on girls) as young as five key technology-literacy skills such as algorithmic thinking. Brad successfully transferred the project from Research to a product team, where the re-imagined game went on to be awarded a nomination for “Outstanding Innovation In Gaming” and was one of two finalists for the “Family Game of the Year” in the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences’ 2016 DICE Awards.

Brad also led the team which shipped the world’s most popular graphics imaging engine. This engine has rendered the image pixels for the default Windows image viewer in every version of Windows since 2006.

When taking breaks from technology, Brad enjoys keeping active by cycling, hiking, watching movies and enjoying travel and the outdoors with friends and family.
