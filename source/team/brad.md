Prior to founding Human Enginuity SPC, Brad co-founded LearnBIG and served as its CTO, where he architected and developed pioneering online e-Learning experiences that industry experts and customers alike referred to as “stunning”, “exceptional”, “effective” and “unique”. Brad served as LearnBig's CTO through its successful acquisition in May 2015.

Brad began programming in BASIC, 6510 and later 68K assembly language. Then, *after* the demise of the dinosaurs, evolved to work in C, Modern C++, Javascript, C# and Rust.  Current projects include a stealth project developing a large-scale, real-time embedded systems product in Rust. Recent work includes co-developing and shipping a major financial payment service on top of the U.S. Federal Reserve banking system.

Prior to this, Brad worked at Microsoft Research leading the Kodu Game Lab initiative, developing a technology platform, curricula and collaborations with several major universities in the U.S., Canada and abroad.  The initiative was successful in achieving its goals, having been shown to have developed technology literacy, critical and algorithmic thinking skills in children as young as five, with a particular emphasis on girls.  Subsequently, Brad transferred the project to the Microsoft Xbox team, where a re-imagined and upgraded version of the game went on to be awarded a nomination for “Outstanding Innovation In Gaming” and was one of two finalists for the “Family Game of the Year” in the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences’ 2016 DICE Awards.

Brad also led the team which shipped the world’s most popular graphics imaging engine. This engine has rendered the image pixels for the default Windows image viewer in every version of Windows since 2006.

When taking breaks from technology, Brad enjoys keeping active by cycling, hiking, watching movies and enjoying travel and the outdoors with friends and family.
